            <p>I discovered my passion for web development when I built my first website in college. Since then, I've been fascinated by the intersection of design and functionality, always striving to create digital experiences that are both beautiful and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coffee shops, reading tech blogs, or working on personal projects that challenge me to learn new technologies.</p>
